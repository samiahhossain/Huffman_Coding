# Huffman Coding

This program asks the user for a message to be encoded. It creates a Huffman tree based on given letter probabilities, and creates the encoded message. It decodes the message back to ensure an accurate algorithm.

*Huffman.java and Pair.java are my own work. LettersProbability.txt and BinaryTree.java are included and used with permission.*
